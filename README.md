# Removing Noise from CMBR to Produce Primordial Sky-map with Non-Gaussianity
 The earliest available signature of primordial universe keeps beaming isotropic from all direction viewable from the sky, known as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) Radiation. This unavoidable signal in sub-millimeter and microwave carries information since the transparent state of universe which could be simulated, deduced and matched with cosmological theories and hypothesis. This study shows an image process-oriented approach to removing noise from CMB whole sky-map along with alleviating White Gaussian Noise. The Temperature Intensity from each pixel of the the maps are speculated and meticulously normalized to obtain an approximate primordial status of CMB which accordingly would help the prediction-matching and simulation for the young observable universe.
